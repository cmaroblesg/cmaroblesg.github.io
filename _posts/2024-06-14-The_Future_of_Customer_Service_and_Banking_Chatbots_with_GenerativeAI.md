## Transformative Impact on Customer Service
Generative AI enables chatbots to deliver highly personalised and context-aware interactions. Unlike traditional chatbots, these advanced models can understand and retain context over long conversations, providing responses that feel natural and engaging. This means:
- **Enhanced Customer Satisfaction**: Chatbots can handle complex queries with ease, reducing the need for human intervention.
- **Increased Efficiency**: With AI handling routine inquiries, customer service teams can focus on more complex issues.
- **Cost Savings**: Automating a larger portion of customer interactions leads to significant cost reductions.

- **24/7 Availability**: Customers can access services and get answers anytime, anywhere.
