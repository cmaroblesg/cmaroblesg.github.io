It involves practices that ensure data is accurate, accessible, secure, and usable. This process is vital for transforming raw data into valuable insights that drive business decisions.

## Why Data Management is Important for Business Culture:

1. **Informed Decision-Making:** Reliable data allows businesses to make strategic decisions based on facts rather than intuition, leading to improved outcomes and profitability.

2. **Compliance and Security:** Effective data management helps organisations comply with legal regulations and safeguard sensitive information. This builds trust with customers and stakeholders, reducing the risk of data breaches and legal issues.

3. **Innovation and Growth:** Access to quality data enables businesses to identify trends, innovate, and stay competitive. With well-managed data, companies can quickly adapt to market changes and capitalise on new opportunities.

4. **Enhanced Collaboration:** A strong data management culture promotes transparency and collaboration across different departments. When data is easily accessible and well-organised, teams can work more efficiently towards shared goals, leading to better overall performance.

5. **Operational Efficiency:** Properly managed data streamlines business processes by reducing redundancies and errors. This leads to more efficient operations, cost savings, and a better allocation of resources.
