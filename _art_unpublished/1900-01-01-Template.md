**Description:** *“Poppies in the Breeze”* portrays a tranquil journey between dreams and nature, where a young woman cycles along a rural path on a bicycle made of flowers. The wheels, turned into giant poppies, lend the scene an air of enchantment. The golden light of the sunset bathes the fields and accentuates the delicacy of the moment. The viewer is invited to drift into the warm, contemplative atmosphere, to appreciate the fusion of the real and the dreamlike, and to let the visual poetry of the landscape evoke memories of freedom, summer, and wistfulness.
