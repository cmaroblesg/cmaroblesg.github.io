**Description:** *“London’s Fiery Dusk”* captures the iconic silhouette of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament, as the sky erupts in a vivid blaze of orange, red, and gold hues. The setting sun casts its final light across the River Thames, reflecting the intense colours onto the rippling water, creating a radiant mirror image. The thick brushstrokes of the sunset contrast with the sharp, dark outlines of the architecture, evoking a sense of timelessness and grandeur. The viewer is invited to bask in the warmth of the moment, where the majesty of London meets the sublime beauty of nature’s evening display.*

**Prompt:** A vibrant, impressionist-style painting depicting a glowing sunset over London, with the iconic Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament silhouetted against the radiant sky. The enormous sun dominates the background, casting a rich, golden hue over the entire scene. The sky is dotted with swirling orbs of light, adding a dreamlike, almost Van Gogh-inspired texture. The reflections of the glowing sky and city lights shimmer across the surface of the Thames River, adding depth and movement to the piece. The bold contrast of the deep blues and fiery oranges evokes a sense of surrealism and magic in this representation of the London skyline.
