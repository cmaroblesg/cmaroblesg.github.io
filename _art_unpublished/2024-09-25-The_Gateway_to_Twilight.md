**Description:** *“The Gateway to Twilight”* presents a mesmerising scene where the sun sets through a massive natural arch carved into the cliffside by millennia of oceanic force. The sky is alight with vibrant purples, pinks, and oranges, casting a warm glow on the water and cliff face. The gentle waves lap against the shore, reflecting the soft colours of the sunset, creating a seamless transition between earth, sea, and sky. The monumental arch frames the fading sun, serving as a symbolic passage from day to night. Viewers are invited to reflect on the ephemeral beauty of nature’s grand cycles, encapsulated in this moment of serene majesty.
