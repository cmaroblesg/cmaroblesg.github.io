**Description:** *"Aurora Silente"* captures the fleeting instant when the light of early morning unveils the silhouette of a contemplative female figure. The interplay of backlight envelops her profile in an aura of stillness and essential beauty. The softness of the surroundings, along with the curtains diffusing the light, lends an ethereal quality to the scene. The viewer is invited to focus on the harmony of the form and the subtle interaction between body and environment, evoking the quiet of the soul in the day’s first glow.

**Medium:** Flux(dev)\
**Prompt:** Soft, warm light filters through a patterned screen, casting intricate shadows across the figure of a woman standing in profile. Her skin glows against the interplay of light and shadows, highlighting the graceful lines and contours of her back and hips, while her long hair cascades down one side, enhancing the sense of movement. The room is minimally decorated, with sheer curtains framing the window, hinting at the serene atmosphere of dawn or dusk. The overall composition emphasizes both vulnerability and strength, conveying a poignant yet intimate narrative of beauty and melancholy captured in a moment of quiet reflection.
