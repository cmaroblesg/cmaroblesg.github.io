**Description:** “Luminous Skies Over Tokio presents a captivating night-time scene where the towering brilliance of the Oriental Pearl Tower dominates the skyline. The full moon glows softly against the deep blue sky, while its reflection, along with the tower’s radiant lights, shimmers across the tranquil waters below. The skyline of skyscrapers adds to the urban majesty, their lights twinkling like stars in the night. This piece invites the viewer to appreciate the harmony between the man-made and the celestial, as vibrant colours and textures converge to depict Shanghai’s electric allure under the glow of a full moon.

**Prompt:** A stunning digital artwork capturing a night-time scene featuring a tower resembling the Tokyo Tower, dramatically illuminated against the backdrop of a colossal full moon. The tower's lights glow warmly, reflecting off a calm body of water beneath, creating a mirror image. The moon appears unnaturally large in the sky, casting a soft glow over the entire cityscape. Surrounding the tower, modern skyscrapers stretch upwards, while the tranquil water and dark foliage at the base balance the urban elements with natural calm. The overall effect is surreal and dreamlike, combining elements of city life with celestial grandeur. The image should resemble a hand-painted piece, with an impressionist or baroque style, and visible palette knife strokes that give it the texture and feel of an authentic oil painting.
