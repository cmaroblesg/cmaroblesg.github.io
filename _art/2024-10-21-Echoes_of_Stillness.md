**Description:** *“Echoes of Stillness”* captures a moment of perfect alignment between body, nature, and the cosmos. A lone figure meditates upon concentric ripples drawn into a zen garden, her silhouette framed by the golden light of sunrise. A blossoming cherry tree offers gentle contrast to the minimal architecture, symbolising the fleeting yet eternal beauty of presence. The tranquil sea and soft horizon beyond evoke peace without words. This piece reflects the profound strength in stillness, where silence becomes the loudest truth.

A tranquil digital illustration portraying a meditative scene within a modern Zen garden during a serene sunset. A solitary female figure sits in lotus position, silhouetted against the warm glow of the horizon, facing a radiant cherry blossom tree adorned with vibrant pink flowers. The meticulously raked sand garden flows in elegant, concentric patterns, guiding the eye toward the blossoming tree and the sinking sun. Long shadows stretch softly across the sand, cast by the low sunlight, while minimalist stone walls and carefully placed boulders frame the scene in quiet harmony. The gentle scattering of pink petals and the golden-orange sky blend nature and architectural calm, evoking a profound sense of peace, balance, and spiritual introspection in this moment of mindfulness.
