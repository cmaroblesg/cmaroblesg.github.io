**Description:** “The Ceremony of Steam and Silence” elevates the humble coffee cup into a vessel of ritual and reflection. Delicate tendrils of steam spiral upward, while a perfect leaf of latte art blossoms at the surface, capturing the fleeting beauty of the moment. Set against pristine porcelain and flanked by cinnamon sticks and a polished spoon, the composition exudes warmth, calm, and understated grace.

This piece invites the viewer to slow down and honour the quiet luxury of presence — a single cup, a sacred breath, a fleeting but flawless pause in time.

A beautifully rendered digital artwork of a steaming cup of coffee or latte, resting on a pristine white saucer atop a glossy marble table. The surface of the latte showcases an intricate leaf-shaped foam art design, elegantly swirled across the dark coffee base. Wisps of steam rise softly into the air, adding a warm and inviting atmosphere. A shiny metal spoon is placed neatly beside the cup, while two curled cinnamon sticks rest on the saucer, lending an aromatic and refined accent. The scene is illuminated with soft, natural lighting that casts delicate shadows, highlighting the textures and reflective surfaces. The clean composition and minimalist style create a calming and indulgent moment, perfect for a serene morning ritual.
