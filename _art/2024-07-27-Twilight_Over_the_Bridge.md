**Description:** *"Twilight Over Tower Bridge"* captures the iconic London landmark in a vibrant pointillist style. The bridge, depicted with countless small dots of colour, stands majestically over the River Thames, reflecting the warm hues of the setting sun. The shimmering effect created by the technique gives the scene a lively, magical quality. The intricate architectural elements of the bridge are mirrored in the water, enhancing the symmetry and balance. The soft, twilight-lit cityscape in the background adds depth. Viewers should appreciate the precision of the pointillist technique and the harmonious blend of natural and architectural beauty.
