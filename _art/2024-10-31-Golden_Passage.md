**Description:** *“Golden Passage”* immerses the viewer in the heart of autumn, where every fallen leaf whispers of time’s gentle retreat. The symmetrical avenue, adorned with warm-hued trees, benches, glowing lanterns, and pumpkins, becomes a sanctuary for introspection. The subtle haze in the distance lends the piece a dreamlike serenity, inviting the observer to stroll not just through the season, but through memory itself.
