**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A black-and-white portrait of a young woman with a soft, contemplative expression as she sits at a table with a cup of coffee:3.0. Her short, dark hair frames her face, accentuating her delicate features and natural freckles:2.9. She wears a thin-strapped top, with light falling gently on her skin, highlighting the texture and softness of the scene:2.9.

On the ceramic surface of the coffee cup, the word “crobles” appears in a faded handwritten script:2.8, blending softly into the grayscale aesthetic and adding a personal touch to the composition.

The shallow depth of field keeps the focus on her eyes and the subtle emotion they convey, while the rest of the image softly blurs, lending an air of intimacy and quiet reflection:3.0.
