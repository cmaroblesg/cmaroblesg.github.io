**Description:** *“When the Sea Dreams in Colour”* captures the sublime stillness of a sunset where sky and ocean melt into one radiant harmony. Vivid hues of amber, lavender, and turquoise dance across the waves, echoing the last breath of day before twilight’s hush.

The painting evokes a deep emotional resonance — a celebration of endings that feel like beginnings, and of nature’s quiet majesty. It invites the viewer to listen not with ears, but with the heart, to the timeless rhythm where light meets tide and the world sighs in peace.

**Prompt:** A highly detailed, HD, realism-style,  full body ultra-realistic-artistic-photo. A stunning photograph capturing a serene ocean view at sunset, where the sky and water merge into a dreamlike palette of colours. Gentle waves softly lap against a smooth sandy shore in the foreground, while the calm sea reflects luminous hues of turquoise, rose, and shimmering gold. Above the horizon, the sky transforms from deep violet clouds into a vivid burst of pink, orange, and yellow as the sun gently descends. The golden light bathes the scene in tranquillity, and the pastel reflections on the water surface enhance the calm, ethereal atmosphere. This perfectly composed moment captures nature’s quiet grandeur with breathtaking clarity and colour.
