### Description:
*"The Lighthouse in the Tempest"* captures the majesty and power of the sea as it faces a storm, with a towering lighthouse standing as a tireless guardian on the coast. The artwork is notable for its impressive use of colour and texture, evoking a sense of movement and dynamism in the turbulent waves and swirling clouds. The warm light of the sunset contrasts with the ferocity of the ocean, symbolising hope and resilience in the face of adversity. This piece, with its vivid representation and intricate technique, invites the viewer to contemplate the duality of nature: its beauty and its uncontrollable power._
