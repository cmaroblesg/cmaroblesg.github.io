**Description:** *“The Spirit Within the Smoke”* depicts a moment of silent communion between a lone woman and a spectral dragon formed from swirling ink-like mist. Dressed in a crimson kimono, she kneels at the edge of an undefined space, facing the ancient force that materialises before her. The emptiness around them amplifies the gravity of the encounter. With its haunting gaze and ghostly form, the dragon embodies inner strength, fear, and wisdom. This piece invites the viewer to reflect on the quiet courage it takes to face one’s own inner mythology with grace and stillness.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A lone female geisha kneels calmly at the centre of an endless white void:3.0, her posture grounded and solemn:2.9. She is viewed from behind:2.8, her silhouette outlined by the surrounding emptiness:2.9, suggesting stillness and spiritual readiness.

Towering above her is a colossal dragon:3.0 formed entirely from swirling smoke and dark mist:3.0. The creature looms with ghostly intensity:2.9, its glowing eyes piercing the void:3.0 and its form drawn in ink-like tendrils that dance and dissolve into the sky:2.8. The dragon’s presence is ethereal yet divine, radiating immense power and ancient mysticism:3.0.

The stark contrast between the pure, empty space and the dramatic, swirling darkness of the dragon:3.0 creates a deeply symbolic atmosphere of spiritual confrontation:2.9. The composition blends minimalism with surreal motion, evoking themes of inner strength, fate, and timeless mythology.
