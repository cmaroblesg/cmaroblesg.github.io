*“Rain Station”* captures a moment filled with emotion and stillness, in which a young girl stands before a train emerging from the darkness. The rain falls relentlessly, creating a play of reflections on the wet ground. The viewer is invited to appreciate the subtlety of the gesture, the light that envelops the scene, and the expectant quietude of the moment, as though everything is on the verge of change.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A lone woman stands quietly on a dimly lit rural train platform during a rainy evening, her silhouette framed against the glow of an approaching yellow commuter train. She wears a traditional pleated uniform, her dark backpack resting on one shoulder, and her figure slightly backlit by the golden headlights of the train as they reflect dramatically across the glossy, rain-soaked tracks.

The atmosphere is steeped in moody green and gold tones, with streaks of falling rain adding a cinematic texture to the scene. Overhead, utility poles stretch into the distance, silhouetted against a swirling, overcast sky. On either side of the platform, nature intrudes with soft foliage and shadows, lending a tranquil harmony to the otherwise urban setting. The scene captures a perfect moment of solitude and introspection, filled with quiet anticipation and emotional depth.
