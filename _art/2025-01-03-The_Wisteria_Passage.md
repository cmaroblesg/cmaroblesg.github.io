**Description:** *“The Wisteria Passage”* evokes the sensation of walking through a portal into a dreamlike realm, where delicacy and splendour of nature merge into a perpetual embrace. The viewer is invited to be carried away by the symphony of tones and undulating forms, feeling the promise of peace, renewal, and eternal beauty hidden among the veils of wisteria that guard the path.

**Prompt:** A highly detailed, HD, realism-style,  full body ultra-realistic-artistic-photo. (((a breathtaking sprawling wall covered in cascading wisteria blossoms:3.0))), dyed in (((vibrant shades of purple and violet:3.0))).

Below, a (((meticulously arranged flower bed blooming in neat rows of pink and white blossoms:2.5))) follows the same curve. In the foreground, ((vividly coloured flowering shrubs:2.0))—red, magenta, white, and blush pink—add bursts of lively contrast against the ((lush green lawn:2.0)). The entire scene radiates ((harmony and botanical grandeur:2.5)), resembling a ((fantasy garden:2.0)).
