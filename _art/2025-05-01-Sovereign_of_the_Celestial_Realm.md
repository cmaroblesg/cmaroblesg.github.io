**Prompt:** A highly detailed, HD, realism-style, full body ultra-realistic-artistic-photo. A majestic celestial winged empress floats gracefully within a vast marble temple beneath the moonlit sky. She is adorned in an elegant, flowing white gown accented with intricate golden embellishments and a radiant crown that gleams with divine brilliance. Her enormous glowing wings are fully outstretched, bathed in the celestial energy that pours from the full moon behind her. She holds a golden staff crowned with a luminous orb symbolising cosmic power, as arcs of lightning crackle dramatically around the moon. Towering marble columns and a polished floor reflecting her ethereal form enhance the scene’s regal, supernatural atmosphere.
