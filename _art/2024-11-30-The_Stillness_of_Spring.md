**Description:** *"The Stillness of Spring”* portrays a tranquil lakeside cottage bathed in the soft embrace of blooming trees and golden sunlight. Nestled at the foot of rolling emerald hills, the modest stone house gazes out over a serene lake, its calm waters mirroring the sky and blossoms with gentle clarity.

Surrounding the home, vibrant wildflowers bloom in joyous contrast to the soothing blues and greens, creating a harmonious palette that celebrates the season’s renewal. Distant mountains rise in layers of blue haze, lending the scene a sense of timeless retreat. This piece offers a quiet ode to rural life—where silence speaks, nature heals, and time slows into beauty.
