**Description:** *“Where Petals Fall”* portrays a moment of sublime stillness in the heart of spring. A majestic cherry tree in blossom dominates the scene, while the sun sets in a sky awash with warm tones. Petals drift softly through the air, echoing the ephemeral nature of natural beauty. The viewer is encouraged to appreciate the harmony between sky, river, and falling bloom, and to allow this image to awaken a quiet, almost wistful emotion. It is an invitation to find the eternal within the momentary.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A dreamy, anime-style digital painting of a serene spring sunset. A cherry blossom tree in full bloom stands prominently beside a tranquil river, its pink petals gently falling and dotting the ground and water's surface. The setting sun casts a golden-orange hue across the sky, gradually transitioning into soft purples and pinks that mirror the blossom-laden landscape. The river glistens in the sunset light, flowing peacefully through the forest of similarly blossoming trees. The entire scene exudes a calm, almost magical atmosphere, blending seasonal beauty with poetic stillness.
