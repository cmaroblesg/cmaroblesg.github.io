**Description:** *"Primavera en Belém"* captures the timeless grace of Lisbon’s Belém Tower framed by a corridor of blooming jacaranda trees. The rich purples and radiant golds of the scene evoke a season of rebirth, where history, architecture, and nature converge in lyrical harmony.

The gentle shadows, scattered cars, and strolling figures ground the scene in everyday life, while the delicate painterly texture elevates it to something almost dreamlike. This piece invites the viewer to walk down that flower-lined avenue, to feel the breeze off the river, and to revel in the poetry of a city in bloom.

**Prompt:** A stunning daytime photograph of the iconic Belém Tower in Lisbon, Portugal, viewed from a distant elevated city street lined with blooming jacaranda trees. The 16th-century stone fortress stands prominently at the end of the symmetrical road, perfectly framed by vibrant purple blossoms and rows of parked cars stretching along both sides. The straight, urban avenue creates a strong visual axis that guides the eye directly to the historic tower, enhancing its majesty and cultural significance. Beyond the fortress, the turquoise waters of the Tagus River shimmer under a clear blue sky, while a lush, green hillside adds depth to the coastal landscape. The composition beautifully balances historic architecture, urban life, and seasonal floral splendour, capturing the unique charm of Lisbon in spring.
