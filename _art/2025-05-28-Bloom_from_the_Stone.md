**Description:** *“Bloom from the Stone”* presents a radiant cluster of wildflowers growing from a moss-covered rock in a quiet forest glade. Bathed in morning light, each petal gleams with life—vibrant reds, soft pinks, luminous yellows, and pure white—forming a natural bouquet that stands as both miracle and metaphor. The blurred woodland background frames the flowers with gentle mystery, while scattered petals whisper of change. This piece is a tribute to nature’s resilience and the quiet strength that blossoms even in the most unlikely places.
