**Description:** *“Daughter of Tide and Sky”* emerges as a celestial embodiment of the union between water and air. Her form, woven from waves, clouds, and light, dissolves the boundary between earth and ether. With the ocean crashing behind her and sky-brushed clouds blooming across her chest, she becomes the spirit of equilibrium — a muse of both serenity and power. Viewers are invited to contemplate the divine beauty found in nature’s duality, and the silent strength of a presence born of elements.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A surreal and poetic digital painting of a woman whose silhouette embodies the convergence of earth, sea, and sky. Her form is seamlessly composed of vibrant elements: ocean waves curl into her limbs, lush greenery forms her legs, and brilliant sunlight radiates through cloud patterns across her torso. The figure stands facing forward, evoking serenity and strength as she emerges from a fusion of stormy skies and tidal forces. With windswept hair and arms gracefully relaxed, she appears as a guardian spirit of nature’s elements, framed by swirling clouds and crashing waves. The background is softly textured, further emphasising her ethereal presence.
