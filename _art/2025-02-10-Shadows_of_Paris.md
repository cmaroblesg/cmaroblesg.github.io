**Description:** *“Shadows of Paris”* presents the silhouette of a couple enveloped in the twilight glow before the iconic Eiffel Tower. The interplay of shadows and golden light cloaks the scene in an atmosphere of remembrance and wistfulness. The presence of a suitcase suggests an emotional or physical journey, while the anonymity of the figures allows the viewer to project their own story. This work invites contemplation on the beauty of transience and the depth of silent connections that define us.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** An abstract, emotionally evocative scene featuring two dark, shadowy silhouettes standing side by side against a textured, sepia-toned backdrop. The taller figure, broad and square-shouldered, holds a briefcase, while the slender figure beside him wears a short dress, both faceless and undefined, enhancing the mood of ambiguity and mystery.

Behind them, softly blurred in the distance, the faint vertical shape of the Eiffel Tower rises through the haze, adding a subtle Parisian element to the atmosphere. The background blends warm ochres, muted browns, and aged parchment textures, applied with sweeping, impressionistic brushstrokes. This creates a nostalgic tone, filled with emotional stillness and quiet intimacy, where time feels paused between the figures.
