**Description:** *"Valley of Dawn"* captures the serene beauty of a mountain valley bathed in the first light of day. Majestic snow-capped peaks rise in the distance, softened by the warm golden glow of the rising sun. A gentle stream winds through the valley, reflecting the sky's soft hues of orange and pink. Tall pine trees stand as sentinels, their dark greens contrasting with the warm tones of the grass and the cool blues of the mountains. A light mist adds a touch of mystery, enhancing the tranquility of the scene. This painting invites viewers to immerse themselves in the peacefulness of nature's early morning splendour.
