**Description:** *“Quiet Mornings in Rue Lumière”* paints a tender scene of early stillness. A young woman sits alone at a café table, her gaze lost in the charm of a sun-kissed cobblestone street. Around her, blooming flowers and soft awnings infuse the morning with warmth. The untouched cups suggest a moment suspended, as if time itself were sipping from the silence. This piece captures the grace of solitude and the gentle rhythm of city life before it begins to stir.

**Prompt:** A highly detailed, HD, realism-style,  full body ultra-realistic-artistic-photo. A romantic and serene illustration in soft watercolour style depicting a young woman seated at a quaint outdoor café table along a charming Parisian street. She wears a light floral dress and has her hair loosely tied back, gazing thoughtfully toward the sunlit avenue. The soft morning light bathes the cobbled street and classic French architecture in a dreamy glow. Around her, flower pots overflow with colourful blooms, vintage café awnings stretch across wrought-iron balconies, and the scene is framed by the elegant façades of Montmartre’s historic buildings. On the table, delicate china cups hold steaming coffee and tea, adding warmth and intimacy to the tranquil setting. The entire composition radiates peace, nostalgia, and the gentle beauty of a quiet Parisian morning.
