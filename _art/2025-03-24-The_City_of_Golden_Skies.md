**Description:** *“The City of Golden Skies”* is a visual ode to an idealised metropolis, carved amid crimson canyons and crowned with radiant golden domes. The scene portrays a living city where neoclassical architecture merges with the bustle of an ancient marketplace. The viewer is invited to contemplate the contrast between monumental grandeur and everyday life, and to appreciate the interplay of light and shadow that evokes a mystical world suspended between myth and history.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** An epic fantasy-style digital painting portraying a breathtaking ancient city carved into and built above towering red cliffs. The architecture is majestic and classical, with grand white stone buildings crowned by radiant golden domes, spires, and intricate colonnades. These elegant structures are masterfully integrated into the natural rock, rising tier by tier with the terrain and spanning across a colossal natural stone arch that bridges the canyon. A wide central avenue bustles with life, as crowds of people in flowing, colourful garments move between marketplace stalls and ceremonial terraces, suggesting a vibrant festival or daily gathering. The entire city is bathed in warm golden light, which casts dramatic shadows that accentuate the rich textures of stone and architecture. Overhead, a sky of soft, swirling clouds adds movement and scale to the composition. The image radiates a powerful sense of ancient civilisation, wonder, and epic grandeur.
