**Description:** *"Harmony on the Hill"* captures the beauty and serenity of a picturesque Mediterranean village nestled on a hillside. Using the pointillist technique, the artist creates a vibrant and luminous representation, evoking a sense of calm and harmony. The village is dominated by an imposing castle atop the hill, with majestic towers overlooking the red-roofed, light-stone houses. The orderly arrangement of houses, surrounded by cypress trees and green shrubs, contrasts beautifully with the natural landscape. Winding paths and stairs connect the homes, creating a sense of cohesion and community. At the base of the hill, a small stone bridge spans a stream, adding rustic charm to the scene. The villagers, depicted in everyday activities, bring life and dynamism to the painting. The warm, bright colours and golden sunlight infuse the artwork with an atmosphere of tranquillity and happiness. This masterpiece is a testament not only to the artist's technical skill but also to the simple and timeless beauty of rural life.
