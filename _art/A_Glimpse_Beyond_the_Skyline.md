**Description:** *"A Glimpse Beyond the Skyline"* presents a tranquil moment of introspection, where a young woman gazes silently across the river towards a glowing metropolis bathed in the amber hues of sunset. Perched upon her shoulder, a small bird echoes her stillness, as if sharing her thoughts.

Her figure, draped in a sapphire dress, contrasts with the warm palette of the cityscape beyond. A solitary sailboat glides along the water, casting gentle ripples in the golden light. This composition captures the subtle poetry of longing, the grace of stillness, and the quiet connection between soul and sky.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** An expressive oil-style painting of a woman seated calmly on the edge of a rooftop, her back turned to the viewer as she gazes toward a sprawling city skyline beneath a vivid, cloudless blue sky. She wears a strapless deep navy-blue dress, subtly fitted, paired with flowing orange trousers that cascade softly over the ledge, catching the warm sunlight. Her hair is gathered into a loose, casual bun. Perched delicately on her right shoulder is a small bird, its presence adding a tender, contemplative note to the serene composition. The textured brushstrokes create a lively interplay of light and colour, blending abstract energy with vivid realism. The contrast between her quiet pose and the distant city below evokes introspection, solitude, and the quiet beauty of stillness in a busy world.
