**Description:** *“Stillness in Light”* captures a tranquil moment suspended in golden afternoon light. A pair of delicate white flowers stand tall in a slender glass vase, their presence softened by the warm illumination streaming through a nearby window. Every shadow cast across the wooden table speaks of stillness and introspection.

Beside them, a small turquoise ceramic jar rests atop a simple wooden tray, anchoring the composition with quiet gravity. The backdrop, painted in expressive strokes of blue and ochre, evokes a dreamlike calm, enhancing the contemplative nature of the scene. This work invites the viewer to appreciate the grace of simplicity and the poetry found in everyday spaces.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A serene still-life composition featuring a tall, clear glass vase placed gently on a smooth wooden table, cradling two softly blooming cream-coloured flowers. Their elegant petals and dark green leaves are supported by gently curving stems, gracefully leaning toward the soft natural light streaming in from a nearby window. The sunlight casts delicate, elongated shadows across the warm wood grain, enhancing the tranquil mood. Beside the vase rests a small ceramic teal jar, its subtle, matte texture and muted hue providing a harmonious contrast in both colour and material. The entire arrangement is set atop a simple wooden tray, contributing to the clean balance and minimalist aesthetic. The composition evokes a quiet moment of contemplation, blending modern Japanese-inspired interior design with nature’s understated beauty.
