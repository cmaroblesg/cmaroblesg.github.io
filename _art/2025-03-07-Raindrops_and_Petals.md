**Medium:** DAll-E\
**Prompt:** A young woman with long, slightly damp dark hair:3.0 is seated quietly in a vast field of blooming daisies, gently holding a large bouquet of daisies in her lap:2.5. She wears an ethereal off-shoulder white dress that melts into the misty, rain-kissed surroundings:2.5, flowing naturally over the wet grass. Droplets of rain:2.0 fall softly from the overcast sky, touching her hair and dress, creating a calm and melancholic ambiance. The background is lost in white mist, suggesting an infinite expanse of wildflowers. Her gaze is downward and serene, embodying quiet grace and solitude in the midst of nature's stillness.
