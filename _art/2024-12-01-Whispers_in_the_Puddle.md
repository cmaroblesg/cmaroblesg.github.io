**Description:** *“Whispers in the Puddle”* captures a serene encounter between two cats, one slender and poised, the other soft and contemplative, as they meet beside a mirror of rainwater that blends earth and sky. Their reflections shimmer like whispered thoughts, hinting at silent stories unfolding between them.

Set in a pastel dreamscape where buildings and trees dissolve into gentle light, this piece invites stillness and introspection. It speaks to the beauty of companionship, the poetry of opposites, and the quiet wonder found in the everyday dance of light and fur.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A serene and whimsical digital artwork depicting a fluffy white cat standing in the middle of a puddle on a quiet, empty street. The surface of the water mirrors the sky above with such clarity that it creates the illusion of clouds and a streetlamp existing beneath the ground. Each gentle step from the cat sends soft ripples through the reflection, distorting the sky below in a dreamlike motion. The colour palette features pastel blues and creamy whites, bathing the scene in a tranquil, contemplative light. The composition beautifully blends reality and illusion, capturing a fleeting moment of quiet magic where sky and street seem to merge beneath the paws of the serene feline.
