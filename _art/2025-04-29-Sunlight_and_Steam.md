**Description:** *“Sunlight and Steam”* bathes the senses in the golden light of a quiet morning. A steaming cup of coffee rests upon a sunlit windowsill, beside woven baskets brimming with jubilant, multicoloured blooms. The impressionistic texture imbues the scene with life, as though each petal and beam of light dances gently with the air. Through the window, a garden in bloom blurs softly, echoing the warmth and contentment of simple, tranquil moments.
