**Prompt:** A serene rustic scene captures a steaming cup of cappuccino placed on a soft brown blanket atop a wooden deck beside a log cabin. Beside the cup, a piece of dark chocolate rests on the saucer, and a chocolate-glazed doughnut with sprinkles lies nearby. A charming dried bouquet of pink and white flowers and wheat stems adds a touch of countryside warmth. In the background, tall grasses sway gently in the morning breeze, with mist rising over a forested valley. The golden hues of the sunrise bathe the scene in a peaceful, amber glow, suggesting a perfect start to a tranquil day in nature.
