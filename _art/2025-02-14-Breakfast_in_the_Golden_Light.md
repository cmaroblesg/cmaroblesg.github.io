**Description:** *“Breakfast in the Golden Light”* evokes the stillness of a Parisian morning, enveloped in a warm and embracing atmosphere. From the balcony unfolds an intimate view of the city’s classic rooftops, while the silhouette of the Eiffel Tower fades into the golden morning haze, like a delicate memory yet to dissolve.

The wrought iron table and chairs, accompanied by a steaming teapot, two coffee cups and a bowl of freshly baked croissants, suggest a scene of simple shared joy. Each element is bathed in the gentle sunlight filtering through the climbing vines, illuminating the moment with a warm palette of ochres and golds.

The viewer is invited to pause time and savour, if only briefly, the bliss of the present. This work is a tribute to the art of living with sensitivity and contemplation, in a corner where everyday life becomes poetry.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A sun-kissed Parisian balcony at sunrise glows with soft golden light as the day begins. A small round black table is perfectly set for two, with a polished silver teapot, two ceramic cups, and a rustic bowl brimming with buttery croissants. Two wrought iron-framed chairs with cream-coloured cushions are tucked neatly under the table, surrounded by cascading greenery in terracotta planters.

The ornate iron balcony railing elegantly frames the scene, with a breathtaking view of Haussmann-style buildings across the quiet street, their classic façades and balconies glowing in the warm morning sun. The air is filled with stillness and charm, capturing the tranquil intimacy of an early Paris morning.
