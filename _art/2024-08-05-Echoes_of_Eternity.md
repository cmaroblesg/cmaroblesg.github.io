**Description:** *"Echoes of Eternity"* captures the timeless majesty of the Giza Pyramids and the Great Sphinx, rendered in striking sepia tones. The monumental pyramids rise from the desert sands, symbolising the architectural and spiritual achievements of ancient Egypt. The Great Sphinx, with its enigmatic gaze, stands in stoic guardianship before the pyramids. The warm sepia tones evoke a sense of antiquity, while the bold black ink contrasts dramatically with the sky, emphasizing the timelessness of these ancient wonders. The artwork invites viewers to reflect on the grandeur and enduring mystery of a civilisation that continues to fascinate.
