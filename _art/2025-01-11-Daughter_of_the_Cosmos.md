**Description:** *“Daughter of the Cosmos”* portrays a celestial being emerging from the tranquil waters, her form woven from constellations and the midnight sky. Her hair, like strands of starlight, drifts into the ether, merging with the vastness above. The luminous full moon crowns her silhouette, symbolising the divine unity between the earth, the sea, and the heavens. Viewers are drawn into this mesmerising vision, where the boundaries between humanity and the universe dissolve into a single, eternal breath.
