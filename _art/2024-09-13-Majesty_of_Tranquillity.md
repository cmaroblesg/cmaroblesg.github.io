**Description:** *“Majesty of Tranquillity”* captures the grandeur of a colossal palace nestled in verdant surroundings. The magnificent domed structure, with its intricate carvings and vast courtyards, symbolises both power and serenity. The eye is drawn to the lush, meticulously landscaped gardens, where nature intertwines with man-made beauty. A cascading fountain serves as the focal point of the scene, its sparkling waters reflecting the golden hues of the late afternoon sun. The few figures scattered throughout the scene appear dwarfed by the immensity of the architecture, inviting the viewer to contemplate the peaceful harmony between the monumental and the serene.
