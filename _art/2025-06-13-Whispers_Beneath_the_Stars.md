**Description:** *“Whispers Beneath the Stars”* portrays a moment of quiet awe as a cat gazes into the vast night sky from a harbour’s edge. Above, the Milky Way unfurls in a celestial dance of light, while golden city lights shimmer across the water, anchoring the viewer to the human world. The cat, motionless and mesmerised, becomes a symbol of solitude, curiosity, and cosmic wonder. The delicate yellow flowers that line the path mirror the stars above, suggesting a profound unity between earth and sky.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A dreamy nocturnal scene shows a cat sitting on a path lined with vivid yellow flowers, gazing out over a calm harbour at night:3.0. The scene is illuminated by the glowing lights of docked ships and industrial cranes, which shimmer across the tranquil water:2.9.

Spelled out in a delicate arc of scattered yellow petals on the path in front of the cat is the word “crobles”:2.9, as if arranged by the breeze, blending naturally with the dreamlike setting.

Above, the sky bursts into a swirling galaxy of stars and glowing celestial clouds, creating a magical, ethereal atmosphere:3.0. The cat, sitting in still contemplation, adds a sense of peace and solitude to the surreal landscape:2.9.
