**Description:** *“Eternal Vigils at Stonehenge”* presents a majestic alignment between the ancient monoliths and the Milky Way on a clear night above the Salisbury Plain. The artist captures the poetic connection between earth and sky, where the megalithic stones seem to stand in quiet guardianship of the passing stars. The twilight glow dissolves into the cosmic expanse, inviting the viewer into a visual meditation on time, mystery and permanence. Each star hangs like a note in a silent symphony, orchestrating a visual harmony of eternity.

**Prompt:** A highly detailed, HD, realism-style,  full body ultra-realistic-artistic-photo. A breathtaking long-exposure photograph capturing the ancient monument of Stonehenge under a dazzling night sky dominated by the Milky Way. The massive standing stones rise in solemn silhouette against a pitch-black horizon, exuding mystery and prehistoric reverence. From the centre of the stone circle, the Milky Way arcs powerfully across the heavens, its glittering star fields and sweeping dust lanes vividly visible in cosmic detail. The surrounding landscape is cloaked in soft shadow, with just enough natural ambient light to outline the monument and its sacred arrangement. This awe-inspiring composition merges terrestrial antiquity with celestial wonder, evoking a sense of timelessness, cosmic connection, and the quiet grandeur of humanity’s enduring mysteries.
