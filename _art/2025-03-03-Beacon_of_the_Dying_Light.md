**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** An expressive impressionist painting of a coastal scene at dusk, featuring a lighthouse casting a warm golden beam over a turbulent sea. Bold, textured brushstrokes capture the motion of waves crashing against dark rocks, while the vibrant sky transitions from deep purples to fiery oranges, evoking the last light of day. The thick layers of oil paint lend a dramatic and dynamic quality to the landscape, where light, water, and atmosphere merge in vivid, emotive harmony.
