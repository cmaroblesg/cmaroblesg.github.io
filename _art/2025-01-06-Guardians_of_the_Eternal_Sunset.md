**Description:** *“Guardians of the Eternal Sunset”* portrays a timeless gathering of ancient stone sentinels beneath a breathtaking evening sky. Bathed in brilliant hues of orange, coral and violet, the towering moáis stand solemnly, silhouetted against the setting sun. A winding path lined with vivid wildflowers leads the viewer toward the horizon, where earth and sky embrace in a tender farewell. This work invites contemplation on the enduring legacy of human spirit and the quiet dialogue between history and the natural world.
