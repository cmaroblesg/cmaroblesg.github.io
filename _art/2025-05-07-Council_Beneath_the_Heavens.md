**Description:** *“Council Beneath the Heavens”* presents a moment of profound reverence within a chamber steeped in both artistic grandeur and spiritual authority. Rows of cardinals cloaked in crimson form two living walls that lead the viewer’s gaze to the central figures—draped in white, bearing the weight of sacred responsibility.

Above, celestial frescoes cascade from the ceiling, echoing the divine presence watching over this solemn conclave. The gold and ochre tones of the walls and floor ground the composition in warmth and timelessness, while the muted expressions of the clergy evoke contemplation and unity.

This masterpiece offers more than ecclesiastical ritual; it invites the beholder to reflect on the lineage of faith, the quiet power of tradition, and the intricate theatre of the divine unfolding upon earth.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A solemn and ceremonial scene unfolds within the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican, capturing a significant ecclesiastical moment involving Catholic cardinals. The image showcases a gathering of cardinals, distinguished by their red cassocks and birettas, symbolising their rank and role in the Roman Catholic Church. They are assembled in an orderly manner, possibly preparing for or participating in a papal conclave—the sacred process of electing a new pope. The sacred walls are adorned with rich tapestries and iconic Renaissance frescoes, including parts of Michelangelo’s ceiling, reinforcing the setting’s profound spiritual and historical gravity. Clerics in white and black vestments assist the cardinals.
