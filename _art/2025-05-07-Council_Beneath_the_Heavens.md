**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A solemn and ceremonial scene unfolds within the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican, capturing a significant ecclesiastical moment involving Catholic cardinals. The image showcases a gathering of cardinals, distinguished by their red cassocks and birettas, symbolising their rank and role in the Roman Catholic Church. They are assembled in an orderly manner, possibly preparing for or participating in a papal conclave—the sacred process of electing a new pope. The sacred walls are adorned with rich tapestries and iconic Renaissance frescoes, including parts of Michelangelo’s ceiling, reinforcing the setting’s profound spiritual and historical gravity. Clerics in white and black vestments assist the cardinals.
