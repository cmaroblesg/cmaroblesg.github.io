**Description:** *“Under the Ember Moon”* captures the moment where human introspection and the universe collide in a whisper of fire and shadow. The young protagonist, seated upon a mirrored plain, gazes into the immensity of a crimson moon as if beholding a reflection of her own spirit. The warmth of the lunar glow contrasts with the coldness of the horizon, reminding the viewer that even in the deepest solitude, there is a heartbeat of incandescent hope. The artwork invites one to perceive the silent strength of those who, even in darkness, continue to dream.
