**Description:** *“Whispers of the Northern Sky”* captures the ethereal splendour of an arctic night under the spell of the aurora borealis. Vibrant ribbons of emerald, violet and rose waltz across the heavens, mirrored upon a tranquil, frozen lake. The snowy peaks stand guard in reverent silence, while a patch of hardy alpine blooms adds a touch of warmth to the wintry edge. This painting invites the viewer to witness the serene majesty of the cosmos communing with the Earth — a sacred moment where stillness meets celestial grace.
