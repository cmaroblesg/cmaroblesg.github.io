**Description:** *“Café de Luz y Cristal”* invites the viewer into a stained-glass dream, where golden light, wooden chairs, and vases of blooming hydrangeas form an oasis of warmth and stillness. The soft glow of multicoloured lamps bathes the stone walls in gentle hues, while the blooming trees outside add a whisper of springtime poetry.

This piece is a quiet homage to the beauty of interior worlds — those places where colour, calm, and connection linger in the air like music. It is a portrait of serenity, where every chair holds the possibility of presence and every shadow is touched by warmth.

**Prompt:** A highly detailed, HD, realism-style,  full body ultra-realistic-artistic-photo. A richly textured illustration of a charming café interior glowing softly beneath the warm ambience of mosaic glass pendant lamps. These stained-glass-inspired fixtures hang from a high blue ceiling, casting dappled light across the cobblestone-patterned floor and textured walls. Vintage wooden chairs and round tables are arranged in inviting clusters, each table crowned with large, lush bouquets of purple-blue hydrangeas in glass vases. Through the expansive front windows, a wall of pink blossoms spills into view, framing the café in floral elegance. The entire scene is rendered in a style reminiscent of stained glass or mosaic art, blending gentle illumination and rich surface detail to create a dreamy, romantic atmosphere perfect for a quiet evening gathering.
