**Description:** *“Whispers of a New Dawn”* is a poetic celebration of the everyday moment of enjoying a cup of coffee as the sun rises over the city. The warm steam curls skyward like whispered thoughts, meeting the morning birds in flight. Skyscrapers stand softly lit against a dreamy backdrop, where floral silhouettes bloom across the sky, merging fantasy with reality. The viewer is invited to embrace the stillness before the day’s rush, to find sanctuary in simplicity and to witness the magic hidden within the ordinary.

**Prompt:** A highly detailed, HD, realism-style,  full body ultra-realistic-artistic-photo. A dreamlike digital artwork featuring a large teal coffee cup resting in the foreground atop a smooth saucer that seamlessly blends into a surreal cityscape bathed in the soft glow of sunrise. Rising steam from the cup spirals upward, merging gracefully with the golden morning sun as its light cascades across sleek, futuristic buildings and floating botanical patterns. Birds soar toward the horizon, their silhouettes cutting through a sky filled with glowing orbs, translucent floral overlays, and soft pastel hues. The fusion of nature and urban design evokes a magical realism, where glowing flowers and ethereal energy drift through the early morning air. The composition captures a serene yet invigorating moment, symbolising balance, wonder, and the quiet magic of a new beginning in a fantastical city of the future.
