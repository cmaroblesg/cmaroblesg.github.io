**Description:** *“Whispers of the Eternal Muse”* presents a vision of delicate timelessness. A young woman’s gaze, luminous and introspective, seems to carry centuries of untold stories. Woven with golden petals, her hair blends into the sky, as if she were born of light and memory. Behind her, the domes of Rome glow in a gentle dusk, their reflection rippling like a quiet hymn. This piece blurs the line between figure and dream, capturing a muse that lingers not in marble or myth, but in the soul’s quiet longing for beauty eternal.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A highly detailed, HD, realism-style,  full body ultra-realistic-artistic-photo. A dreamy and ethereal watercolour portrait of a woman with delicate, luminous features and striking blue eyes that gaze with serene depth and introspective mystery. Her face softly emerges from a background of blended muted blues, whites, and shimmering gold, interwoven with abstract floral shapes and expressive splashes of colour. Her hair, gently flowing and loosely textured, is adorned with dried petals, tiny twigs, and flecks of gold leaf, giving her an enchanting, otherworldly presence reminiscent of a forest spirit or fae. The brushstrokes are soft and fluid, evoking a tranquil atmosphere that merges fantasy and emotional realism. The composition radiates fragile beauty, feminine mystique, and the gentle glow of magical serenity.
