**Prompt:** A stunningly detailed fantasy artwork depicting an ancient temple city built into the side of a mountain. The architecture is a blend of traditional Eastern design, with ornate pagodas and intricate wooden structures, perched on rocky cliffs and connected by stone bridges. A group of robed figures can be seen walking along one of the bridges, adding a sense of life and scale to the scene. The city is surrounded by misty cliffs and tall, snow-capped mountains in the background, creating a mystical and awe-inspiring atmosphere. The sunlight filters through the mist, casting soft shadows over the detailed carvings and greenery that clings to the rocky terrain.
