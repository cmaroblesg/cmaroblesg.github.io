**Description:** *"Whispers of Spring"* captures the serene beauty of a riverside lined with cherry blossoms in full bloom. The gentle river reflects the soft pink hues of the blossoms and the subtle greens of the grassy banks, creating a tranquil atmosphere. The cherry trees arch gracefully over the water, forming a natural tunnel that invites the viewer to follow the river's path. The soft, misty background and delicate watercolour technique evoke a peaceful morning, inviting reflection and appreciation of nature's fleeting beauty. This painting embodies the quiet elegance of springtime in a tranquil setting.
