**Description:** *“Whispers by the Water’s Edge”* captures the magical stillness of a golden afternoon, where different souls — a dog, a bird, and a rabbit — quietly contemplate the gentle passage of time. Surrounded by flourishing cherry blossoms and houses that whisper stories beneath their warm lights, the protagonists convey a profound sense of connection with nature. The viewer should appreciate the delicacy of the colours and textures, inviting themselves to lose their way in this scene of eternal serenity.

**Prompt:** A highly detailed, HD, realism-style,  full body ultra-realistic-artistic-photo. A serene, pastel-toned digital illustration portraying a traditional East Asian water village basking in the soft, golden light of spring. Wooden docks stretch gracefully over a calm, lily-dotted canal, while charming lantern-lit houses with dark tiled roofs line the water’s edge. Overarching branches adorned with delicate white blossoms frame the composition, adding dreamy depth and gentle motion to the scene. On the dock in the foreground, a fluffy white dog, a curious rabbit, and a small bird sit together peacefully, gazing across the reflective water. The tranquil surface mirrors the quaint village and pastel sky, evoking nostalgia, calm, and perfect harmony with nature.
