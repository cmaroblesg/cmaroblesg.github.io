**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A bunch of multicoloured plums hanging from a branch, adorned with fine dew droplets. Each plum displays a rich gradient of colours from deep violet and indigo to vivid red, orange, and golden yellow, forming a natural rainbow palette. The fresh green leaves provide a vivid contrast to the vibrant fruits. The velvety surface texture of the plums is highlighted with glistening moisture, enhancing their ripeness and juiciness. Soft natural lighting captures the glossy sheen and freshness, creating a lush, almost surreal beauty reminiscent of a sunlit orchard morning.
