**Description:** *“Winter Between Pages”* is a visual ode to stillness and contemplation. Amidst a snow-laden city night, a warmly lit desk reveals an open book, a steaming cup of tea, and flowers standing resilient against the cold. This intimate interior invites the viewer to pause, to breathe, and to lose themselves within the written word, while snowflakes gently fall beyond the window. The piece evokes the comforting solitude of winter evenings, where the warmth of thought triumphs over the chill of the world outside.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A warm and inviting digital painting portraying a tranquil study space during a snowy winter evening. A wooden desk sits in front of a large-paned window, through which soft snowflakes fall against a dusky blue sky, with lights twinkling in distant buildings and cosy houses. The desk is adorned with an open book, scattered pages, a steaming cup of coffee, and a glowing vintage desk lamp casting a gentle golden light. To the side, a vase of cheerful daisies and a small potted plant add a homely touch. The entire scene evokes a feeling of peace, introspection, and the joys of reading during winter.
