**Description:** *"Autumn's Refuge"* captures the idyllic beauty of a grand mountain lodge nestled among the vibrant colours of fall. The lodge, with its intricate architecture and warm red roofs, stands atop a rocky outcrop, surrounded by lush forests and towering peaks. A cascading waterfall flows beneath the lodge, reflecting the rich hues of the surrounding foliage. The sky, painted in soft purples and blues with fluffy clouds, enhances the dreamlike atmosphere. This painting invites viewers to imagine a peaceful retreat in this secluded mountain paradise, where nature's beauty offers a tranquil escape from the world.
