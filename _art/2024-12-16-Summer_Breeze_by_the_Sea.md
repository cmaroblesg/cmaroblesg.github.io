**Description:** *"Summer Breeze by the Sea"* captures the essence of a sun-drenched coastal retreat, where a stone cottage with brilliant blue shutters nestles among a profusion of vivid blooms. The pergola, adorned with trailing vines, offers shelter beneath a sky brushed with soft clouds. In the distance, a lone sailboat drifts across the serene waters, embodying freedom and tranquillity.

The luminous palette of scarlet, gold, and violet flowers against the deep blue sea creates a vivid harmony, inviting the viewer to linger in this timeless haven of warmth, beauty, and gentle sea breezes.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A picturesque seaside stone cottage radiates rustic Mediterranean charm, its bright blue wooden shutters standing out against the sun-bleached stone walls. The terracotta-tiled roof adds a warm, earthy touch to the inviting scene. Above the cottage’s entrance, a pergola heavy with lush, green vines casts soft dappled shadows onto the worn stone path below. Bursting from wicker baskets and lining the terrace, vibrant red poppies and a medley of colourful summer flowers bloom in joyful abundance. Two birds perch lightly on the vine-draped trellis, adding life and whimsy. In the background, the calm blue sea stretches into the horizon, where a solitary sailboat glides peacefully under the vast sunlit sky. The entire setting breathes tranquillity, floral richness, and the refreshing spirit of coastal living.
