**Description:** *“The Scent of Morning Bread”* captures a coastal village bakery basking in golden morning light beneath cascades of purple wisteria. Loaves of warm, crusty bread fill baskets and wooden shelves outside the quaint shopfront, welcoming passers-by with rustic charm. A lilac bicycle stands nearby, as if paused mid-errand. In the distance, sailboats rest gently by the harbour, completing the serene tableau. This painting invites the viewer into a world where fragrance, colour, and tranquillity merge—a gentle ode to the beauty of life’s simple rituals.
