**Description:** *"Autumn’s Solitude"* captures the serene beauty of a park during a gentle autumn rain. A solitary green bench, bathed in the soft glow of a nearby streetlamp, contrasts with the vibrant orange, yellow, and golden leaves of the tree overhead. The wet pavement reflects the colourful foliage and the streetlamp’s light, adding a shimmering quality to the scene. The textured brushstrokes convey the movement of the falling rain, creating a peaceful and contemplative mood. Viewers should appreciate the harmonious balance of colours and the quiet, reflective moment this painting embodies.
