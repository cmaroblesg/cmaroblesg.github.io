**Description:** *“Roses, Wine and Alpine Silence”* captures a tranquil lakeside reverie where love and serenity meet under the embrace of the Alps. A table adorned with ripe berries, a creamy dessert, and two glasses of wine rests amidst blooming roses, overlooking a peaceful village nestled at the water’s edge. The snow-capped peaks reflect softly on the lake, echoing the stillness of a moment meant to be savoured. This piece celebrates the poetry of pause — a toast to beauty, intimacy, and nature’s eternal grace.

A round table draped in a crisp white cloth is elegantly set beside a crystal-clear lake, surrounded by blooming red roses that add a passionate flourish to the tranquil setting. On the table rest two sparkling glasses of red wine, a delicately plated dessert garnished with fresh berries, and a bowl of ripe strawberries, all inviting a moment of intimate indulgence. In the distance, a charming European village with classic steeple-topped buildings nestles at the lake’s edge, framed by majestic, snow-capped mountains rising into the serene sky. A small boat glides slowly across the lake, its reflection shimmering in the calm water as the golden light of late afternoon bathes the scene in warmth. The composition evokes luxury, peace, and romantic serenity amidst the grandeur of nature.
