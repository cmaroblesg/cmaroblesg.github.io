**Description:** *“Gate of Eternal Echoes”* resurrects the legendary splendour of Babylon through the vivid portrayal of the Ishtar Gate — a majestic threshold adorned with cobalt tiles and golden beasts that seem to shimmer with divine memory. The golden structures to either side, veiled in cascading greenery, whisper of fabled gardens and lost empires.

Reflected in a tranquil canal, the scene blends myth and memory, inviting the viewer to step into a forgotten world where art, architecture, and ritual once stood in perfect harmony. This piece is not merely historical — it is a poetic resurrection of a civilisation that continues to echo through the corridors of time.

**Prompt:** A majestic digital artwork portraying an ancient Mesopotamian-inspired cityscape centred on a colossal blue arched gate reminiscent of the legendary Ishtar Gate of Babylon. The monumental gate is adorned with gilded accents, detailed ornamental carvings, and depictions of divine creatures, radiating grandeur and sacred significance. Flanking the gate are towering ziggurat-like structures and temples, richly textured with terraced platforms, cascading greenery, and magnificent hanging gardens that drape from every level. The weathered stone architecture reflects the enduring splendour of a long-thriving civilisation. The scene is brought to life with bustling activity—tiny robed figures walk through the wide plazas and stone steps, suggesting a vibrant, prosperous society. Strong vertical lines and perfect symmetry lead the eye through the gate toward a sunlit corridor, creating a powerful sense of scale and historical wonder. The atmosphere fuses fantasy with archaeological realism, evoking the mythic beauty and cultural legacy of ancient Mesopotamia.
