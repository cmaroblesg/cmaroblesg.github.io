**Description:** *"Where the Light Rests"* portrays a tender moment at the edge of twilight, where golden sunlight gently kisses the river’s surface. A wooden bench, quietly poised beneath a sheltering tree, awaits the silent arrival of a soul in search of solace.

The warm hues of the setting sun illuminate a blooming rose bush, infusing the scene with a sense of serene beauty and reflection. The painting exudes a wistful stillness, encouraging the viewer to linger in the quiet magic of the hour when light fades and memories begin to whisper.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A tranquil riverside scene at sunset, where a rustic wooden park bench rests quietly beneath the sheltering branches of a grand, leafy tree. The warm golden light of the setting sun filters softly through the foliage, casting dappled patterns of light and shadow across the grassy ground. The serene surface of the river mirrors the brilliant hues of gold, peach, and soft lavender in the sky. Around the bench, flourishing bushes of vibrant pink roses bloom abundantly, infusing the air with a romantic fragrance and colour. The atmosphere is filled with peaceful stillness and gentle warmth, evoking an ideal moment of solitude and quiet reflection in the embrace of nature.
