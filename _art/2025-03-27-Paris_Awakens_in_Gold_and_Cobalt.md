**Description:** *“Paris Awakens in Gold and Cobalt”* captures the French capital at that ephemeral moment when day succumbs to night, and the city’s lights emerge like stars on the earth. From an elevated perspective, the Arc de Triomphe commands the foreground, glowing warmly as roads spiral from its base in a dance of movement and colour.

The Eiffel Tower, luminous and ethereal in the distance, rises through the cobalt haze, touched by the last hues of sunset. The brushwork is vibrant and expressive, drawing from the Impressionist tradition to imbue the scene with emotion and rhythm. The viewer is invited to drift above the Parisian streets, where history, romance and artistry converge beneath a twilight sky.

**Prompt:** A stunning aerial view of Paris captured at twilight, revealing the city's refined architectural elegance and its most iconic landmarks aglow. In the foreground, the Arc de Triomphe commands the Place Charles de Gaulle roundabout, encircled by flowing trails of vehicle lights that form brilliant circular patterns. Radiating from the centre, symmetrical rows of Haussmann-style buildings highlight the beauty of Parisian urban planning. In the distance, the Eiffel Tower rises gracefully, its golden illumination contrasting with the soft gradient of the evening sky, where purples, deep blues, and fading daylight blend in harmony. Natural twilight and city lights merge, casting a romantic glow across rooftops and boulevards. The entire scene captures the timeless allure, vibrancy, and poetic charm of the French capital as day melts into night.
