**Description:** *“Whispers of Dawn”* captures the poetry of a moment where nature and the soul seem to whisper to one another. The composition highlights the harmony of contrasts — the white cat and the black cat, darkness and light — framed by a field of daisies softly swaying beneath the first rays of the sun. The viewer is invited to appreciate the serenity of the moment and the subtle promise of a new beginning suggested on the mist-shrouded horizon.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A serene scene at dawn where a black cat and a white cat sit quietly together in a wildflower meadow drenched in ethereal mist. The meadow is adorned with dew-kissed daisies and tall grasses, with soft, diffused morning light glowing subtly through the dense fog. In the background, silhouettes of distant trees emerge faintly, enhancing the calm, dreamlike atmosphere. The striking contrast between the cats' fur adds a symbolic, poetic dimension to the peaceful setting.
