**Description:** *“Echoes Beneath the Tides”* unveils a submerged world of ancient ruins and drifting silence. Enshrouded in hues of emerald and sapphire, forgotten temples and crumbling columns rise from the ocean floor, wrapped in seaweed and memory. Graceful jellyfish glide through the gloom like spectral guardians of the past. A gentle glow filters from above, casting a dreamlike aura upon the scene. This underwater vision invites the viewer to reflect on the impermanence of civilisation and the timeless power of nature’s quiet reclamation.
