**Description:** *"Whispers of the Cliffs”* presents a stunning coastal tableau where chalk-white cliffs rise with silent grandeur above glistening emerald waters. A solitary sailboat glides peacefully along the shoreline, echoing the calm strength of the towering cliffs. Each shadow and ripple in the sea tells a story of wind and tide, of journeys taken and those yet to begin. This piece captures the harmony between earth and ocean, inviting the viewer to drift alongside the wind and listen to the quiet poetry of the waves.

**Prompt:** A highly detailed, HD, realism-style,  full body ultra-realistic-artistic-photo. A vibrant aerial view capturing the breathtaking white chalk cliffs of Étretat along the Normandy coast of France. Towering natural arches and dramatic vertical formations rise from the turquoise and deep blue waters of the English Channel, their sheer faces gleaming in the summer sunlight. In the foreground, a graceful sailing yacht glides serenely near the rocky shoreline, while a smaller boat floats closer to a secluded sandy cove. The cliffs are crowned with lush, rolling green fields that stretch inland, crisscrossed by winding pastoral roads. Puffy cumulus clouds drift across a brilliant blue sky, casting soft, shifting shadows on both land and sea. The water shimmers with a mosaic of emerald, cyan, and navy tones, perfectly reflecting the interplay of light and motion. This composition blends natural grandeur with serene maritime beauty, creating a majestic yet tranquil coastal panorama.
