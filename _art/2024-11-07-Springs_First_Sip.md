**Description:** *“Spring’s First Sip”* invites the viewer into a ritual of renewal through the language of ink and symbolism. A single bowl of red tea floats serenely amidst stylised waves, encircled by plum blossoms and peonies in bloom. A red lantern sways gently beneath the rising sun, while clouds and calligraphy dance across the canvas in harmonious rhythm. This piece is an ode to beginnings — a visual haiku where spring, warmth, and presence steep in delicate stillness.

**Prompt:** A highly detailed, HD, realism-style,  full body ultra-realistic-artistic-photo. A striking traditional Asian ink-style digital artwork composed in a harmonious arrangement of powerful cultural symbols. At the centre rests a ceramic bowl filled with deep red tea or wine, encircled by stylised swirling waves and elegant floral motifs. Plum blossoms and full-bloom peonies unfurl delicately in flowing black and red ink strokes, their petals graceful and bold against the white canvas. Rising in the background is a large crimson sun, partially obscured by intricately rendered clouds with flowing, traditional linework. A red lantern hangs to the side, paired with flowing vertical calligraphy that adds poetic rhythm and ceremonial tone to the composition. The monochrome and red palette exudes elegance, with every element symbolising balance, seasonal beauty, and quiet celebration. This artwork blends Japanese and Chinese influences into a tranquil yet rich visual ode to nature and ritual.
