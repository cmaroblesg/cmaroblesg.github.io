**Description:** *“The Watcher of the Bay”* presents a serene coastal moment, as a tabby cat sits calmly beside blooming yellow flowers, gazing at the industrial harbour beyond. Cranes and ships stand tall under a sky brushed with soft clouds, while a lone butterfly dances over the glistening water. The peaceful coexistence of nature and industry, sunlight and steel, becomes a meditation on stillness, curiosity, and the unspoken stories told through a gaze towards the sea.
