**Description:** *“Evening Choices”* portrays a tranquil urban moment steeped in quiet whimsy. A glowing red vending machine, brimming with colourful drinks, stands beneath blooming cherry blossoms as petals drift like soft whispers. A white cat, bathed in its light, gazes intently—caught in a silent exchange with the inanimate, yet somehow animate, machine. Set against a dusky blue sky and golden lamplight, the scene evokes wonder, solitude, and the beauty found in the most unexpected pauses of city life.
