**Description:** *“Wishes in a Jar”* captures the surreal charm of a glowing goldfish enclosed within a glass jar, casting warm light into the heart of a darkened forest. The fish radiates as though it holds a secret flame, its presence illuminating nearby leaves and softly glowing orbs that hover like fireflies. This quiet, dreamlike scene blends whimsy with introspection, symbolising the fragile beauty of kept hopes and the quiet magic of the unknown. It invites the viewer to ponder what dreams might flicker, unspoken, within the confines of silent glass.
