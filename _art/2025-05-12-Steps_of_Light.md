**Prompt:** A lone female figure ascends a luminous, floating staircase suspended in a dark, ethereal void:3.0.

At the summit, a burst of glowing butterflies appears to dissolve into light, symbolising transformation or transcendence:2.0. The woman, shown from behind, walks barefoot with quiet resolve:1.8, framed by the contrast between the surrounding darkness and the radiant path ahead:1.5. The scene conveys themes of personal journey, enlightenment, and inner awakening:1.2, blending surreal fantasy and symbolic light composition.
