**Description:** *"Mountain Sanctuary"* captures the tranquil beauty of a secluded mountain cabin nestled in a lush meadow. The rustic log cabin with its green roof exudes warmth and homeliness. The surrounding meadow, filled with wildflowers and grasses, blends harmoniously with the natural environment. Towering pine trees and majestic snow-capped mountain peaks add depth and seclusion to the scene. The gentle, natural lighting enhances the vivid colours of the landscape. Viewers should appreciate the peaceful and serene atmosphere, inviting them to escape into this idyllic retreat.
