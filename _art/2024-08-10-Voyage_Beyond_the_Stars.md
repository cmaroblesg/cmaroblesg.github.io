**Medium:** OpenArt SDXL\
**Prompt:** A ((futuristic, sleek, and modern spacecraft:1.5)) designed for ((interstellar travel:1.6)), captured in a ((digital artwork style:1.4)). The spacecraft has a ((streamlined metallic body:1.5)) with ((intricate paneling:1.4)) and ((glowing energy conduits:1.5)) running along its length. The ((propulsion system:1.6)) at the rear is ((large and powerful:1.5)), emitting ((blue plasma trails:1.6)) that shimmer in the vacuum of space. The spacecraft is equipped with ((solar panels:1.5)) to capture energy from the stars, ((advanced technology:1.6)) to collect ((moisture:1.4)), ((potential fuels:1.5)), ((precious minerals:1.4)), and ((futuristic systems:1.6)) capable of ((harvesting dark matter:1.7)) and ((converting it into fuel:1.6)). The space station is ((massive:1.6)), capable of housing nearly ((100,000 people:1.5)), and is not necessarily ((disc-shaped:1.4)). The background features a ((distant galaxy:1.5)) with ((vibrant hues of purple and blue:1.6)), with the spacecraft illuminated by ((faint starlight:1.5)), casting ((soft shadows:1.4)) across its surface. ((Distant planets:1.4)) are barely visible in the background, adding ((depth:1.5)) to the composition. The image should be in a ((landscape horizontal resolution:1.4)), with ((realistic textures:1.5)) and ((coherent colours:1.4)), avoiding ((incorrect proportions:1.5)). --style digital rendering --ar 16:9 --q 8 --v 5 --seed 4928537
