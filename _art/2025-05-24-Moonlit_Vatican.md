**Description:** *“Moonlit Vatican”* depicts the grandeur of St. Peter’s Basilica under the ethereal glow of a full moon. Golden lamplight spills across the ancient stone bridge and ripples gently over the Tiber River, guiding the viewer into the sacred heart of Rome. The composition balances celestial light with human architecture, blending sky and structure in a luminous harmony. With each brushstroke, the painting evokes reverence, timelessness, and the serene beauty of a city that holds centuries of faith and splendour.
