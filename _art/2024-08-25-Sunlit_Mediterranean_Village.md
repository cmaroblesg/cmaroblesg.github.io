**Description:** *"Sunlit Mediterranean Village"* is a digital masterpiece that captures the beauty and tranquillity of a coastal village set against the backdrop of the Mediterranean Sea. Bathed in the warm, golden light of the afternoon sun, the scene highlights the vibrant pastel colours of the buildings and the rich, terracotta rooftops that define the village. The composition is balanced by the towering church, which adds a sense of history and culture, while the bright orange flowers in the foreground contrast beautifully with the azure waters. The calm sea, lush greenery, and idyllic beach nestled between rocky cliffs create a serene and inviting atmosphere, embodying the charm and beauty of Mediterranean coastal life.
