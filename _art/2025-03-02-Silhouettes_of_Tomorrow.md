**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A vibrant digital artwork depicting a high-rise building at night, covered in dense greenery and softly glowing lights from the windows. Each apartment balcony is uniquely adorned with potted plants, vines, and small trees, blending nature with urban architecture. The building stands in contrast to a distant futuristic city skyline filled with tall skyscrapers and bright neon lights in hues of pink, blue, and purple. The scene balances modern technology with eco-conscious design, portraying a peaceful coexistence between urban life and nature, all under a star-speckled twilight sky.
