**Description:** *"Vibrant Echoes"* captures the serene beauty of a monochromatic garden brought to life by the vivid colours of two hummingbirds. The bright greens, reds, purples, and golds of the birds contrast strikingly with the grey tones of the surrounding garden, drawing the viewer's attention to their dynamic presence. One hummingbird hovers mid-flight, while the other perches gracefully, creating a balance between motion and stillness. The selective use of colour enhances the contrast and harmony in the scene, inviting viewers to appreciate the delicate interplay of nature's vibrant energy against a timeless backdrop.
