**Description:** *“Moonlit Refuge”* captures the quiet poetry of a solitary cottage glowing gently beneath an oversized golden moon. Set within a dark forest and mirrored in the stillness of a nearby pond, the house becomes a beacon of comfort in the hush of night.

Bathed in rich blues and soft ambers, the scene invites the viewer into a world where solitude is not emptiness, but sanctuary. This piece speaks to the warmth of home, the magic of stillness, and the enduring light that flickers even in the darkest woods.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A magical and atmospheric illustration of a cosy countryside cottage bathed in the golden glow of a full moon. The small white house, with its stone chimney and glowing windows, rests quietly on a gentle hillside, surrounded by tall, bare trees whose branches stretch into the night sky. The full moon looms large behind the treetops, casting soft golden light across the scene and reflecting perfectly in the still, dark waters of a nearby pond. The rich texture of the moss-covered stone walls and earthy greens contrasts with the deep blues and radiant golds of the moonlit sky. The entire composition captures a serene sense of mystery and peaceful solitude, like a scene lifted from a fairy tale or timeless storybook.
