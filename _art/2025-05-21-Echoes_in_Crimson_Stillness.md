**Description:** *“Echoes in Crimson Stillness”* presents a bold and contemplative still life, where vivid red poppies emerge from a matching ceramic vase, accompanied by a striking red teacup. Set against a deep, shadowy background, the brilliant reds take on a luminous quality, accentuated by the quiet reflections on the glossy surface. Two fallen petals gently hint at fragility and the passage of time. This piece invites the viewer to pause and reflect—on silence, on beauty, and on the delicate balance between presence and absence.
