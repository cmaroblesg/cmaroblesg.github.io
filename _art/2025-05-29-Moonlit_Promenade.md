**Description:** *“Moonlit Promenade”* captures a tranquil, moonlit path winding through a blossoming garden beneath a velvet sky. Antique lampposts cast golden halos over the cobblestones, echoing the gentle glow of the full moon above. Colourful flowers line the walkway—vivid reds, soft whites, and pale blues—while a stone fountain to the side offers the illusion of quiet movement. The painting invites the viewer into a moment of serenity and wonder, evoking the peaceful beauty of a midnight stroll where nature and light blend into a dreamlike symphony.
