**Description:** *“Radiance in Bloom”* presents a strikingly vivid orange hibiscus in full flourish, its textured petals unfolding like waves of sunlight. The rich crimson heart draws the eye inward, while the pistil rises boldly at the centre. Framed by lush green leaves, the flower’s brilliance is amplified by the cool, abstract background of blues and aquas rendered in soft, dreamy bokeh. This piece celebrates the floral essence of tropical warmth and the profound beauty contained in a single moment of botanical splendour.

**Prompt:** A vivid orange hibiscus flower:3.0 in full bloom stands tall on a lush green stem with vibrant leaves:2.9.

Rising elegantly from the heart of the bloom is a prominent stamen and stigma:3.0, shaded in warm yellow and deep red:2.9, adding both colour and texture.

The softly blurred background is rendered in dreamy hues of teal and aqua:2.9, enhanced with circular bokeh light effects:2.8 that lend a tranquil, artistic depth to the scene.
