**Description:** *“Reflections at Dusk”* portrays a tranquil tabby cat nestled among blooming yellow flowers, gazing quietly at the vibrant hues of a harbour sunset. The sky, ablaze with orange and rose, mirrors softly on the water where distant ships linger. The scene invites stillness and reflection, honouring the subtle beauty of twilight and the quiet soul who pauses to witness it. This painting is a meditation on endings, serenity, and the timeless grace of a solitary gaze.
