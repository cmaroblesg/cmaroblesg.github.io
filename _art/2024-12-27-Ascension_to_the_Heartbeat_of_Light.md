**Description:** *“Ascension to the Heartbeat of Light”* symbolises the intimate journey towards the essence of love and hope. The ascending spiral staircase leads to a portal of light shaped like a heart, reflecting the perseverance of the soul in the face of challenges. The viewer is invited to perceive the contrast between the heaviness of the shadows and the lightness of the ascent, as well as the determination to reach that which truly illuminates the spirit.

A woman dressed in a flowing white mini dress ascends a spiralling iron staircase suspended in the open sky. The staircase winds upward into a dense cloudscape, where a large heart-shaped opening radiates an intense, warm heavenly light. The surrounding clouds are painted in rich shades of grey and blue, creating a powerful contrast with the brilliant central glow. At the final step, the woman reaches out toward the heart with a sense of awe and longing, capturing a surreal and emotional moment of aspiration and transcendence.
