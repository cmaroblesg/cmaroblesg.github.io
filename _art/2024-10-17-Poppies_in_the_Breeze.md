**Description:** *“Poppies in the Breeze”* portrays a tranquil journey between dreams and nature, where a young woman cycles along a rural path on a bicycle made of flowers. The wheels, turned into giant poppies, lend the scene an air of enchantment. The golden light of the sunset bathes the fields and accentuates the delicacy of the moment. The viewer is invited to drift into the warm, contemplative atmosphere, to appreciate the fusion of the real and the dreamlike, and to let the visual poetry of the landscape evoke memories of freedom, summer, and wistfulness.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A surreal digital artwork portraying a woman cycling along a winding dirt path that meanders through a golden wheat field glowing under warm sunlight. The scene exudes a dreamlike quality, with the most fantastical element being the bicycle itself—its wheels replaced by large, blooming red poppies, their petals caught in a gentle breeze. The woman rides with serene grace, dressed in a flowing olive-green dress that flutters as she moves, and a wide-brimmed hat adorned with matching red flowers. Her expression is calm and reflective, evoking a sense of inner peace and quiet freedom. The natural curve of the path draws the eye through the golden landscape, enhancing the feeling of motion. In the distance, a tiny figure near the bottom right adds whimsy and scale, deepening the sense of narrative and surreal charm. The rich contrast between the fiery red poppies and the warm wheat hues brings the composition to life in a poetic, vintage-inspired fantasy.
