**Description:** *“Whispers Beneath the Spiral Moon”* captures a night of enchantment where the sky unfurls in concentric waves of golden clouds, all converging upon a radiant full moon. The celestial display mirrors the quiet path below, which glistens with moonlight and leads through a softly shadowed landscape. Bloom-filled baskets on the roadside glow with a subtle luminescence, bridging the heavens and the earth. This piece invites the viewer to walk slowly, to listen to the night, and to feel the quiet pull of the universe’s rhythm.
