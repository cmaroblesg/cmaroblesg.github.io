**Description:** *“Paws on the Square”* blends whimsy with grandeur as three cats, mid-selfie, pose wide-eyed before an iconic monument. A humorous nod to travel snapshots in a feline universe.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** Three expressive cats with wide-eyed, open-mouthed faces:3.0 appear in the foreground, dramatically posing as if snapping a selfie in front of the illuminated Tiananmen Gate at night:2.5. Their anthropomorphic expressions—surprise, excitement, and mischievous glee—add a surreal and humorous tone to the scene. Behind them, the majestic architecture of the Forbidden City glows with warm golden lighting:2.0, casting an ambient halo that enhances the historical grandeur of the landmark. The polished stone and tiled roofs shimmer under the city lights, contrasting sharply with the absurd playfulness of the feline trio. The cats' fur textures are crisp and realistic, lit softly by the surrounding illumination, grounding their cartoonish behaviour in a photorealistic setting.
