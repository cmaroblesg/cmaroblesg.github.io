**Description:** *“Cliffs of Light”* depicts a radiant seaside village, where whitewashed houses crowned with terracotta roofs climb a sunlit slope towards a central dome. The coastline sparkles with the hues of azure and jade, while golden cliffs cradle the settlement in warm embrace. Billowing clouds animate the sky like poetic brushstrokes, complementing the rhythmic texture of land and sea. This painting captures the spirit of Mediterranean timelessness—where every stone, path, and shadow speaks of sunlight, tradition, and the peaceful harmony between earth and ocean.
