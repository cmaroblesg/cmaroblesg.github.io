**Description:** *"Whispers in the Flame"* presents a solitary candle burning atop an ancient tree stump in the heart of a shadowy forest. Its flame emits a soft amber glow, but it is the smoke that draws the eye—lavender tendrils twisting skyward like ethereal incantations. The candle appears less an object of light and more a vessel of forgotten magic, illuminating not merely the surrounding woodland, but the mysteries it holds.

The viewer is encouraged to ponder what force lit this candle, what spell it carries, and who—if anyone—will answer its call. A poignant tribute to the delicate balance between nature, mystery, and unseen enchantment.

**Prompt:** A mesmerising digital illustration featuring a magical candle resting atop a weathered tree stump in the centre of an ethereal forest. The candle’s flame glows warmly with a radiant yellow-orange hue, while swirling tendrils of violet and magenta magical energy spiral gracefully into the air, casting an enchanted glow. The soft light from the flame gently illuminates the surrounding moss-covered wood and forest floor, creating a delicate interplay of light and shadow. In the background, mystical foliage and subtly glowing flora blur into a dreamy backdrop, enhancing the surreal atmosphere. The entire scene evokes a serene, mysterious mood—capturing the quiet power and beauty of magical realism in a hidden woodland realm.
