**Description:** *"Sovereign of the Deep"* reveals the quiet grandeur of an orca gliding through the boundless expanse of the ocean. Illuminated by gentle shafts of sunlight, its body reflects a palette of deep blues and radiant golds, evoking an almost celestial presence beneath the waves.

The dynamic composition and fluid brushstrokes convey both the strength and elegance of this enigmatic creature. Suspended in its aquatic realm, the orca becomes a symbol of freedom and ancient wisdom, inviting the viewer to witness the silent splendour of the natural world in its most primal form.

**Prompt:** A breathtaking overhead view of a powerful orca swimming just beneath the surface of the turquoise ocean. The sleek black and white body of the killer whale cuts effortlessly through the crystalline water, its distinct white eye patches and towering dorsal fin clearly visible. The orca leaves behind a shimmering trail of bubbles and subtle ripples in its wake. Sunlight penetrates the water, dancing in radiant reflections along the orca’s back and enhancing the vivid marine palette. The clarity of the sea reveals intricate details of the orca’s skin texture and elegant motion, creating a sense of fluid grace and awe-inspiring natural beauty.
