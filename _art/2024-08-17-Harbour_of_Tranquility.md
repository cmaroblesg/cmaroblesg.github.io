**Description:** *"Harbour of Tranquillity"* captures the serene beauty of a coastal village nestled against the backdrop of majestic mountains. The scene, set at dawn or dusk, features a sky bathed in soft pastel hues that are mirrored in the calm waters of the harbour. The pastel-coloured houses, arranged in a neat line along the waterfront, reflect in the water, adding depth and symmetry to the composition. The dramatic mountains in the background contrast with the delicate village, grounding the scene in natural grandeur. This painting invites viewers to experience the peaceful charm and tranquillity of this idyllic coastal setting.
