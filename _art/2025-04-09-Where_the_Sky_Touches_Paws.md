**Description:** *“Where the Sky Touches Paws”* portrays a solitary white cat crossing a quiet street puddle, its reflection merging with the soft clouds and pale blue sky mirrored in the water. The scene is awash in a luminous stillness, where each brushstroke breathes softness and introspection.

With a near-weightless presence, the feline appears as both creature and ghost — a silent observer between worlds. This piece invites the viewer into a reverie of light and silence, where beauty is born from reflection, and tranquillity becomes an act of gentle wonder.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A serene and whimsical digital artwork depicting a fluffy white cat standing in the middle of a puddle on a quiet, empty street. The surface of the water mirrors the sky above with such clarity that it creates the illusion of clouds and a streetlamp existing beneath the ground. Each gentle step from the cat sends soft ripples through the reflection, distorting the sky below in a dreamlike motion. The colour palette features pastel blues and creamy whites, bathing the scene in a tranquil, contemplative light. The composition beautifully blends reality and illusion, capturing a fleeting moment of quiet magic where sky and street seem to merge beneath the paws of the serene feline.
