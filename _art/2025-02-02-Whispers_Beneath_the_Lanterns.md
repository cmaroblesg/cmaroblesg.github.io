**Description:** *“Whispers Beneath the Lanterns”* immerses the viewer in the quiet elegance of a rain-kissed evening café. Golden lights shimmer upon the wet stone floor, echoing stories untold in the silence of empty chairs and glowing candles. The interplay between deep blues and warm ambers weaves a timeless ambience, inviting reflection and solitude under a sky of whispering trees.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A cosy, rain-soaked courtyard comes alive under the warm golden glow spilling from a house’s windows. Wet stone tiles shimmer with reflections of soft string lights and glowing lamps, creating a striking contrast between the cool blue tones of the rainy evening and the inviting warmth radiating from inside. Small round tables and chairs are scattered throughout, some tucked beneath a large umbrella. Lush green plants and trees glisten with raindrops, their leaves catching hints of light, enhancing the serene, romantic charm of this peaceful scene.
