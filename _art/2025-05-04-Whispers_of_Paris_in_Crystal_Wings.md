**Description:** *“Whispers of Paris in Crystal Wings”* portrays an ethereal scene where a delicate fairy, with a serene gaze and a gentle posture, rests inside an ornate teacup that appears drawn from a baroque fairytale. Her translucent wings, resembling lace or frosted glass, extend softly into a background washed in hues of crimson and twilight blue. In the distance, the silhouette of the Eiffel Tower emerges like a faint, dreamlike memory. This piece evokes a world where the fantastical and the everyday meet in quiet poetry, whispering to the viewer that within the smallest of places, an entire universe may dwell.
