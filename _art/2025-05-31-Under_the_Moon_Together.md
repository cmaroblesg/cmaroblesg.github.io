**Description:** *“Under the Moon, Together”* captures the intimate stillness of two cats seated side by side, overlooking a glowing city under a blazing moonlit sky. The fiery twilight clouds swirl above as golden lights twinkle below, forming a perfect backdrop for this quiet companionship. The cats, silhouetted in serene unity, seem to share not just a view, but a moment of profound connection. This painting celebrates silent bonds, the poetry of dusk, and the quiet grandeur of a world watched from above.
