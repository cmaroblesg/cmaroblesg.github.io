**Description:** *"Swan Song in the Garden"* captures the tranquillity and harmony of a meticulously crafted Japanese-inspired garden in full bloom. The centrepiece of this artwork is a serene pond, home to elegant white swans and vibrant koi fish, reflecting the calm beauty of the surrounding cherry blossoms. The gentle pink petals fall from the cherry trees, creating a soft, natural tapestry against the lush greenery. A stone bridge gracefully arches over the pond, inviting the viewer to step into this peaceful sanctuary. The bright, clear sky and the soft light create an atmosphere of serenity, making this artwork a perfect representation of nature’s calm and beauty.
