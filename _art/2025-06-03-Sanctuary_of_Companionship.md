**Description:** *“Sanctuary of Companionship”* renders a luminous tribute to the sacred bond between a woman and her feline companion through the elegance of stained glass. In radiant amber and celestial blues, their embrace is captured within a halo of golden light, evoking the timeless intimacy of mutual trust. Harbours and cranes in the distance quietly anchor the image in the everyday, while blooming marigolds honour the spiritual grace of the moment. This piece exalts affection not as sentiment, but as devotion—elevated to art, framed in glass, and bathed in eternal light.
