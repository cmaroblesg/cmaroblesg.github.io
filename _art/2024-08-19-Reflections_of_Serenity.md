**Description:** *"Reflections of Serenity"* captures the tranquil beauty of a lotus-filled pond reflecting the grandeur of a distant temple. Bathed in the soft, golden light of dawn or dusk, the temple's spires rise majestically in the background, mirrored perfectly in the calm waters below. The vibrant pink and red lotuses, along with the warm-toned foliage of willowy trees, add texture and colour to the composition. The soft, impressionistic brushstrokes and the gentle play of light create a dreamlike atmosphere, inviting viewers to pause and reflect on the serene beauty of this sacred scene.
