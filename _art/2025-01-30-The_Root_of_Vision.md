**Description:** *“The Root of Vision”* presents a striking fusion between humanity and nature, where a vividly blue eye is encircled by golden roots that weave across the skin like living veins. A single green leaf, poised as a natural brow, crowns this organic gaze. The piece transforms perception into a symbol of unity with the Earth, urging the viewer to recognise the interdependence between sight, awareness, and the world we inhabit. Through this union of human anatomy and botanical form, the painting becomes a poetic meditation on ecological consciousness.
