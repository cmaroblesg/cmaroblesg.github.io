**Description:** *“Stillness in Blue”* invites the viewer into a moment of quiet introspection. A poised woman, elegantly dressed in a vintage gown, sits beside a glowing fishbowl, lost in contemplation. Her vivid red hair, adorned with soft blue flowers, stands in stark contrast to the moody blue palette that envelops her. The two goldfish within the bowl radiate warmth and movement, becoming the emotional core of the composition. The artist masterfully juxtaposes the stillness of the observer with the delicate vitality of the observed, crafting a narrative of longing, beauty, and silent connection.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A surreal scene depicts a woman with vibrant red hair adorned with blue flowers, dressed in an elegant, vintage-style black and grey gown:3.0. She sits gracefully beside a glowing fishbowl containing two luminous orange fish and colourful aquatic plants:2.9. The base of the bowl features the word “crobles” etched in subtle, reflective lettering:2.8, illuminated by the water’s internal glow and blending with the magical ambience.

The scene is bathed in deep blue and teal hues, creating a richly textured and atmospheric backdrop:2.9. The woman is smoking, and the blue smoke from her cigarette whimsically twists into the air, blending seamlessly into the magical atmosphere:2.9. The ethereal quality of the smoke and the luminescent water in the bowl create a dreamlike fusion of fantasy and noir elegance:3.0.
