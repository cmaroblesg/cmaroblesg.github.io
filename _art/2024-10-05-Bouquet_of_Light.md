**Description:** *“Bouquet of Light”* transforms a quiet café into a living canvas of golden ambience and floral abundance. Beneath the glow of stained-glass lamps, tables adorned with violet hydrangeas invite guests to linger, while a vibrant window frames the pink bloom of trees outside like a living painting.

Rendered in textured brushstrokes, this piece blurs the boundary between inside and out, between flower and flame. It is an intimate hymn to presence — to the soft radiance of a shared space, where every surface glows with memory and possibility.

A richly textured illustration of a charming café interior glowing softly beneath the warm ambience of mosaic glass pendant lamps. These stained-glass-inspired fixtures hang from a high blue ceiling, casting dappled light across the cobblestone-patterned floor and textured walls. Vintage wooden chairs and round tables are arranged in inviting clusters, each table crowned with large, lush bouquets of purple-blue hydrangeas in glass vases. Through the expansive front windows, a wall of pink blossoms spills into view, framing the café in floral elegance. The entire scene is rendered in a style reminiscent of stained glass or mosaic art, blending gentle illumination and rich surface detail to create a dreamy, romantic atmosphere perfect for a quiet evening gathering.
