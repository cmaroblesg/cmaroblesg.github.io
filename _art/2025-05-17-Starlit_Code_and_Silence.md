**Description:** *“Starlit Code and Silence”* draws on the swirling magic of a Van Gogh night to portray a modern woman immersed in quiet digital focus. Seated under a sky ablaze with celestial motion, she types on her laptop, bathed in the soft glow of both a lantern and her screen. Her delicate nightdress and peaceful expression convey serenity amidst the cosmic dance above. The scene invites the viewer to reflect on the union between the inner world of thought and the boundless expanse of the night, where inspiration and solitude meet in luminous stillness.
