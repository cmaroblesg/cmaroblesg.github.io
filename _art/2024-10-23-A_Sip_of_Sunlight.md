**Description:** *“A Sip of Sunlight”* evokes the golden essence of a Mediterranean morning. A rustic table, lovingly set with tea, oranges, and an open book, basks in the early sun filtering through vivid blue doors. The soft interplay of shadow and light lends a quiet rhythm to the scene, inviting the viewer to slow down and savour the moment. Here, breakfast is not just a meal — it’s a meditation, a celebration of warmth, simplicity, and the timeless joy found in everyday rituals.

A warm, sunlit illustration capturing the rustic charm of a peaceful countryside veranda during a tranquil Mediterranean morning. Sunlight streams through open blue-framed windows and doors, casting soft golden light across a round wooden table set for a serene breakfast. The table is adorned with a bowl of ripe oranges, a ceramic teapot, matching cups and saucers, a clear glass carafe filled with water, and a freshly poured glass of orange juice. A potted plant sits to one side, while leafy green vines climb and curl around the veranda’s frame, adding natural elegance. Through the open doorway, a glimpse of a quiet garden bathed in gentle morning light completes the picture. The colour palette blends sun-washed blues, vibrant citrus tones, and lush greens, creating a cosy, fresh, and leisurely atmosphere full of rustic Mediterranean warmth and peaceful stillness.
