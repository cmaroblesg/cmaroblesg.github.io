**Description:** *“Whispers Through the Window”* envelops the viewer in the comforting hush of a winter’s evening. A softly lit study reveals an open book, scattered pages, and a steaming cup of coffee — signs of quiet contemplation. Outside, snow falls gently over a silhouetted town, its lights flickering like distant memories. The golden glow of the interior spills across the desk, wrapping each object in a sense of belonging. This piece speaks of introspection, the beauty of solitude, and the stories we revisit when the world grows silent.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A highly detailed, HD, realism-style,  full body ultra-realistic-artistic-photo. A warm and inviting digital painting capturing a tranquil study space on a snowy winter evening. A wooden desk is positioned in front of a large-paned window, where gentle snowflakes drift down against a dusky blue sky. Beyond the glass, distant buildings and cosy houses glow with twinkling lights, adding depth and warmth to the scene. On the desk, an open book rests beside scattered handwritten pages, a steaming cup of coffee, and a glowing vintage desk lamp casting a golden light across the wood grain. To one side, a small vase of daisies and a potted plant bring a cheerful, homely accent to the setting. The atmosphere is peaceful and contemplative, evoking the serene pleasures of reading, writing, and warm solitude during a winter night.
