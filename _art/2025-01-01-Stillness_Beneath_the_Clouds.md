**Description:** *“Stillness Beneath the Clouds”* captures a moment of tender introspection, as a white cat sits quietly beside a rain puddle, its reflection merging with soft clouds and sky. The composition radiates a hush — not emptiness, but presence — where the world is held in a single ripple.

Bathed in muted gold and cool blue, this piece is a gentle meditation on fragility, perception, and the quiet grace found in pausing. It invites the viewer to see not just a cat or a puddle, but a threshold — between earth and sky, between body and soul.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A serene and whimsical digital artwork depicting a fluffy white cat standing in the middle of a puddle on a quiet, empty street. The surface of the water mirrors the sky above with such clarity that it creates the illusion of clouds and a streetlamp existing beneath the ground. Each gentle step from the cat sends soft ripples through the reflection, distorting the sky below in a dreamlike motion. The colour palette features pastel blues and creamy whites, bathing the scene in a tranquil, contemplative light. The composition beautifully blends reality and illusion, capturing a fleeting moment of quiet magic where sky and street seem to merge beneath the paws of the serene feline.
