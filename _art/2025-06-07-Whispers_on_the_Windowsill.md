**Description:** *“Whispers on the Windowsill”* showcases a terracotta pot bursting with pansies in vivid hues of violet, gold, and crimson, illuminated by gentle daylight streaming through a lace-curtained window. Each blossom seems to hold a quiet sentiment, as though the flowers themselves are keepers of the home’s silent joys and tender memories. This piece is a tribute to everyday beauty—a simple arrangement that glows with warmth, familiarity, and a touch of wistful charm.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A terracotta flower pot:3.0 brimming with blooming pansies in vibrant shades of purple, pink, yellow, and blue:2.9 sits gracefully on a rustic wooden windowsill:2.8. The flowers are fresh and full, with lush green leaves spilling naturally over the rim of the pot:2.7, creating a lively and colourful focal point.

Behind the arrangement, a classic wooden-framed window:2.6 reveals a sunlit background softened by delicate white lace curtains:2.5. The soft morning light:2.8 filters through gently, casting warm highlights and subtle shadows across the flowers and the wood:2.7. The atmosphere is cosy, nostalgic, and serene, embodying the charm of quiet domestic life.
