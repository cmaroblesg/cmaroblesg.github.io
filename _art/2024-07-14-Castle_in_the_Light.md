**Description:** *“Castle in the Light”* presents a stunning medieval fortress, surrounded by a wide moat. The castle's robust architecture, with its numerous towers and battlements, is connected to the land by a drawbridge, over which horse-drawn carts pass. In the background, a dense, dark forest contrasts with a bright, sunlit sky, evoking the brushstroke effect reminiscent of Van Gogh’s style. The picturesque reflection of the castle and bridge in the moat's water enhances the enchanting quality of the scene, blending the medieval past with artistic brilliance.
