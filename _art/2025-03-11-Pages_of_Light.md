**Description:** *“Pages of Light”* evokes a serene blend of poetry and nature. A bouquet of soft blooms rises from an open book by the seaside, touched by pastel hues of dawn. The gentle atmosphere invites the viewer into a quiet reverie, where stories bloom with the first light of day.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** An open book rests gently on soft white fabric, with a bouquet of pastel-coloured flowers blooming directly from its pages:3.0. Chrysanthemums, daisies, and roses in delicate shades of lavender, pink, yellow, and white burst upward in full bloom:2.5. Sheer curtains billow gracefully in the breeze, framing a serene view of the calm sea beneath a glowing pink and purple sunset sky:2.0. The scene is filled with poetic charm and peace, bathed in soft ambient light that highlights the textures of petals, paper, and sea breeze.
