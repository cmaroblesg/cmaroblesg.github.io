**Description:** *“Whispers by the Blooming Shore”* evokes the tender tranquillity of a sunlit coastal morning. A modest white cottage, cradled by soft waves of spring flowers, gazes peacefully toward the azure sea. A single wooden boat rests at the shore, embodying stillness and waiting.

The pastel tones and gentle brushstrokes invite the viewer into a world where beauty blossoms quietly, and every petal, wave, and cloud seems to echo a gentle lullaby of peace. It is a portrait of simplicity, of belonging, of nature in quiet bloom.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A luminous painting capturing a peaceful coastal landscape bathed in springtime light. A white stucco house with terracotta-tiled roofs is nestled atop a gentle hillside overlooking the sea, surrounded by a tapestry of blooming pink and purple flowers. A large tree with soft pink blossoms frames the upper portion of the scene, its arching branches casting dappled shadows across the sun-washed façade of the house. The hillside glows with colour, and each flower appears to shimmer as it catches the light, rendered with lively brushstrokes. In the distance, a hazy landmass extends into the calm, deep blue sea beneath a vast, pastel sky. The entire composition evokes a serene Mediterranean atmosphere, filled with the quiet joy of nature and the timeless beauty of coastal life.
