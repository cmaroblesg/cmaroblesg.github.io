**Description:** *“Symphony of Storms”* depicts a spellbinding scene where music and magic collide. In the heart of a misty, lantern-lit forest, a lone musician commands an electric guitar crackling with arcane energy. Her gaze is resolute, her presence magnetic, embodying a harmony of wild beauty and untamed power. The glowing instrument becomes a conduit of emotion, as though each note could bend the world. This piece invites the viewer to witness music not as sound alone, but as elemental force — a storm made symphony, summoned beneath the trees.

**Prompt:** A dramatic digital fantasy artwork portraying a powerful extremely busty female figure standing confidently in a mist-shrouded, enchanted forest illuminated by the soft glow of floating lanterns. She wears a bold, black leather-like outfit with metallic detailing, complemented by flowing, translucent fabric that trails from her waist, adding a sense of mystic elegance to her commanding presence. Her long, tousled hair cascades freely around her shoulders, and her arms are adorned with gleaming metallic cuffs. In her hands, she holds a glowing electric guitar crackling with vivid blue lightning-like energy — a fusion of music and magic. The vibrant neon light from the guitar casts an ethereal glow across the misty undergrowth and highlights the shimmering moisture in the air. The composition merges elements of rock star attitude with arcane fantasy, creating a powerful visual of modern mysticism and raw feminine strength.
