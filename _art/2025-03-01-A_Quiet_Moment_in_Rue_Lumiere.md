**Description:** *"A Quiet Moment in Rue Lumière"* captures the gentle rhythm of a Parisian morning, where sunlight spills like liquid gold across cobbled streets. A young woman, dressed in a delicate floral gown, sits quietly at a round café table, her back turned to us as she gazes down the awakening boulevard.

The soft blur of distant figures strolling past, the striped awnings, and overflowing window boxes recall an impressionist dream. Her presence, still yet expectant, anchors the scene in serenity. The untouched cups suggest a story left untold, a conversation yet to come or perhaps memories being savoured in silence.

This painting invites the viewer to appreciate the elegance of stillness and the charm of everyday rituals, framed by the glow of a city steeped in poetic light.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A young woman sits alone at a small round table outside a Parisian café, dressed in a delicate floral dress that softly sways in the morning breeze. Her back is turned to the viewer as she gazes thoughtfully toward a sun-drenched cobbled street, bathed in golden morning light.

Three porcelain cups sit in front of her, filled with coffee or tea, contributing to a cosy and romantic ambiance. The street is lined with charming Haussmann-style buildings, ornate iron balconies, and striped café awnings. Hanging flower baskets bloom vibrantly around the scene. In the background, casually strolling pedestrians add life to the peaceful, vintage charm of this warm, serene Parisian morning.
