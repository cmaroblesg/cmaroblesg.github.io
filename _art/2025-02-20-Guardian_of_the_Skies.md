**Description:** *"Guardian of the Skies"* immortalises a moment of soaring grace, where a hawk, radiant in hues of amber and flame, commands the heavens with sovereign poise. Set against a backdrop of cerulean skies and wistful clouds, the creature’s powerful wings form an emblem of untamed majesty.

The brushwork—rich and dynamic—breathes motion into the scene, as though the hawk might at any moment beat its wings and vanish into the wind. The viewer is invited to sense not only the visual grandeur but the spiritual resonance of unbound flight, and the quiet nobility of a sentinel watching from above.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A vivid and majestic hawk is captured mid-flight against a radiant blue sky scattered with fluffy white clouds. Its fully extended wings showcase an intricate pattern of feathers in warm amber, russet, cool greys, and luminous whites. Sunlight glints off its plumage, highlighting the hawk's radiant presence. With piercing eyes and outstretched talons, the bird exudes power and grace. The dynamic contrast between the vivid sky and the hawk’s detailed form emphasises its dominance and freedom as it soars above.
