**Description:** *“Sunlit Steps to the Sea”* captures a radiant Mediterranean escape where cascading steps, dressed in vivid cobalt, lead the way to the serene embrace of the ocean. Terracotta pots overflow with blossoms, and sun-kissed walls echo with the quiet joy of summer. A lone sailboat drifts on the azure water, completing the harmony of land, light, and sea. This piece is a celebration of coastal simplicity — a place where each step is a moment of warmth, and every glance holds the promise of peace.

A picturesque coastal alleyway lined with vivid blue-tiled steps and walls, leading gently toward a serene azure bay. The charming Mediterranean architecture features whitewashed façades, ornate wrought iron gates, and colourful decorative plates nestled among terracotta pots overflowing with lush green foliage and blooming red and white flowers. The path curves downward, guiding the eye to the water's edge, where a small white boat glides peacefully across the calm, glistening sea. Towering green cliffs and misty blue mountains frame the background, creating a majestic natural amphitheatre. The soft daylight bathes the entire scene in a tranquil glow, enhancing the vibrancy of the colours and evoking the timeless warmth and charm of a dreamy coastal village escape.
