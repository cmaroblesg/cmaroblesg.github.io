**Description:** *“Echoes of the Dying Sun”* presents a breathtaking view of a secluded cove cradled between ancient cliffs, where the ocean meets the sky in a dance of colour and silence. The fiery orb of the setting sun casts golden hues across the rippling tide, illuminating the shoreline with warm reflections that seem to pulse with the heartbeat of the Earth.

The jagged silhouettes of the cliffs stand solemn and timeless, their dark contours enhancing the ethereal glow at the centre of the scene. Each wave, each shimmer on the wet sand, echoes the grandeur of a farewell — not an end, but a luminous pause before the world’s next breath.

This piece captures the poetic tension between stillness and movement, inviting the viewer to witness the sublime theatre of nature’s daily finale.
