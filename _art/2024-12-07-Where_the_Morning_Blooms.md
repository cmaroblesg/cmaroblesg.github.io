**Description:** *“Where the Morning Blooms”* unfolds a luminous spring awakening, where golden sunlight spills across a meandering stream and a meadow bursting with tulips and daffodils. Blushing cherry trees and soft pastel skies frame the composition, bathing the landscape in warmth and gentle joy.

The sunlight, tender yet radiant, seems to kiss every leaf and blossom, filling the scene with a sense of hope and tranquillity. The painting invites the viewer to wander this enchanting field, to pause in the hush of morning light, and to embrace the promise carried on the breeze of early spring.

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A breathtaking springtime landscape unfolds at dawn, with a gently winding stream weaving through tall green grasses and vibrant clusters of blooming tulips and daffodils in soft shades of orange, pink, and white. On the left, a majestic cherry tree in full blossom stretches its branches skyward, its vivid pink flowers glowing as the early morning sun bursts through, casting radiant golden rays across the misty meadow. The entire scene is bathed in a soft golden hue, with warm light gently illuminating the fresh blossoms, dew-kissed petals, and shimmering water. In the distance, a pastel sky fades into pale blue and soft peach, dotted with silhouettes of other blooming trees. This serene countryside moment captures the magic of spring’s renewal and the stillness of a golden sunrise.
