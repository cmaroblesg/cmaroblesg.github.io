**Description:** *"Spring Basket on a Blue Bicycle"* captures a delicate moment suspended in time, where a vivid blue bicycle holds a wicker basket brimming with fresh, colourful blooms. The contrast between the bike’s bold hues and the soft, pastel background creates a nostalgic, dreamlike atmosphere. The piece invites the viewer to appreciate the quiet beauty of everyday life and to recall gentle memories — of morning rides, sun-dappled paths, and the simple joy of spring’s first bloom.
