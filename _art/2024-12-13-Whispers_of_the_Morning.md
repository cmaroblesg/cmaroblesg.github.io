**Description:** *"Whispers of the Morning"* offers a poetic portrayal of rural tranquillity at dawn. The golden sunlight diffuses gently through a lingering mist, illuminating a meandering path beside a rustic wooden fence. A solitary tree casts its soft shadow while fields of daisies and blooming red peonies bask in the early glow.

The viewer is beckoned to appreciate the fleeting quietude of daybreak, where each petal and beam of light becomes a silent hymn to the gentleness of nature. It is a moment suspended in golden stillness, where even the breeze seems to tread lightly."

**Medium:** Dall-E\
**Prompt:** A rustic countryside scene glows in the warm golden light of sunrise. A weathered wooden fence stretches diagonally across the image, drawing the viewer’s gaze toward a softly glowing horizon where the sun rises gently above a distant line of treetops. The field is alive with delicate white daisies blooming among lush, dewy green grass, catching the early light with subtle sparkle. Low-hanging morning mist blankets the ground in the background, adding a soft, ethereal atmosphere to the rural landscape. To the right, the silhouette of a large, graceful tree balances the composition, its branches framing the sunrise in serene contrast. The entire setting radiates tranquillity, freshness, and the timeless beauty of morning in the countryside.
